{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uk3HqV2sRXZF"},"source":["## Problem Definition\n","\n","The classification of musical genres is important because it helps organize and navigate the vast and diverse world of music, which is crucial for both practical and academic purposes. Practically, it enhances user experiences in streaming platforms, enabling personalized recommendations and efficient content discovery. It also supports music organizations by automating categorization, improving accessibility, and driving music-related business models."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bSzLfACpRh_m"},"source":["# Using Random Forests\n","\n","A Random Forest algorithm is ideal for musical genre classification because it handles high-dimensional data well and captures complex, non-linear relationships between features like tempo and melody. It is robust against overfitting by combining multiple decision trees, improving generalization to new songs. Additionally, it can handle noisy or missing data and provides insights into feature importance, making it a reliable and efficient choice for accurate genre classification."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2429,"status":"ok","timestamp":1743554453349,"user":{"displayName":"Carlos
